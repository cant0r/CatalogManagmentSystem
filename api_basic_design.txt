How shoudl the api look like?

There should be 4 pages, 3 for Users and Admins, and just 1 or maybe antoher for Admins.

User can manipulate the Entry, Medium, and Container tables. Admin can also do it ofc but Admin has access to the Type table (and maybe to Login tables?)

Base should be /api

Example in case of Entry:

/api/entry/all?page=n -- select *, size max 10, idk                                                                                                                                                                                 
/api/entry/ body: id --crud operations
/api/entry/erase
